#Fitman-cam project

###Description of the component
The **Collaborative Asset Management (CAM)** Specific Enabler is a web-based, integrated platform for the management of Virtualized Asset. This Specific Enabler is targeted to the business user, who is not required to have IT expertise, nor an in-depth knowledge of ontology-related concepts and technologies.

CAM is based on several open source components, covering different functional areas; on top of these, it adds a rich layer of web-based, custom front-end functionalities which integrates low-level services into a unified, user-friendly experience.

CAM is delivered as a module that allows the user to manipulate ontologies adding classes and templates and create, manipulate and delete Assets.

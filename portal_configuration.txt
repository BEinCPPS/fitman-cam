Portal Configuration
=====================================================================
The environment is already set up to run from inside the virtual machine in order to configure the platform properly please follow the steps as described.

Definition: all urls are configured as "localhost", this allows the platform to work from inside the virtual machine, the following configuration assumes that the user wants to configure it to work from outside, so we will change "localhost" with the virtual machine public IP, it can be retrieved typing ifconfig in a terminal inside the vm.

Pease use the public IP for the the configuration described below

First start the portal server.

SSO:
	
	When first launched the SSO system is not enabled (also from inside the virtual machine), to configure it follow these steps:
	
	a. Navigate to the portal (example http://localhost).
	
	b. Use the following credentials to login to the portal: Username -> admin Password -> 54321qwerty
	
	c. Go to Control Panel and select the Portal Setting
	
	d. Select the Autentication Section and the CAS Server Configuration
	
	e. Check Enabled.
	
	f. Enter the following parameter:
		
		(Please note that the final configuration for this parameters will look like it is currently set, but with public IP, retrieved before, replacing "localhost")
		
		1. Login URL 
		(Set the CAS server login URL. Users will be redirected to the CAS login page when authenticating into the portal)
		
		2. Logout URL
		(Set the CAS server logout URL. Set this if you want the portal's logout function to trigger a CAS logout.)
		
		3. Server Name
		(Set this to enable deep linking into the portal (e.g. http://localhost:8080). Do not set this if the CAS service URL is set.)
		
		4. Server URL
		(Set the CAS server domain URL.)
		
		5. Service URL
		(Set this to disable deep linking into the portal (e.g. http://localhost:8080/c/portal/login). Do not set this if the CAS server name is set.)
		
		6. No Such User Redirect URL
		(Set the URL to redirect a user to, if the user can authenticate with CAS but cannot be found in the portal. If import from LDAP is enabled, then the user will be redirected if he cannot be found or could not be imported from LDAP.)
 
	g. Save the configuration.

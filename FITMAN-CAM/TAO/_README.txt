Please keep in mind that TAO is:
- only covering tangible aspects;
- not meant to represent any given textile domain, but a manufacturing
  perspective on all industries;
- a prototype, implying the need for fundamental re-work and refurbishment
  as well as merging with other (textile- and/or even service-) ontologies;
